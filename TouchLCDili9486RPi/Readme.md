# Pico Volume and Macro Touch Keyboard 480x320 3.5 inch ILI9486

[**VolumeMacroPad**](VolumeMacroPad125.ino) is a combination of the [**Dustin Watts Pico Touch Macro Keyboard**](https://github.com/DustinWatts/Pico-Matrix-Touch-Keyboard), the [**AdafruitTinyUSB HID examples such as hid_composite.ino**](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TinyUSB_Arduino/blob/master/examples/HID/hid_composite/hid_composite.ino), and the [**Bodmer Keypad example**](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI/tree/master/examples) Keypad_480x320.ino. They were adapted for use on a  [**3.5inch Touch Display (LCD Type B) for a Raspberry Pi 480Ã—320**](https://www.waveshare.com/3.5inch-rpi-lcd-b.htm) by replacing the PicoSDK USB stack with the Adafruit TinyUSB stack - this allowed the use of multimedia keys such as Volume Up-Down-Mute to be added to the standard keyboard touch buttons. Please refer to [**ArduinoboardSettings**](ArduinoboardSettings.jpg) for the Pico board settings in the Arduino IDE.

Connections were made as in [**Interface-definition**](Interface-definition.txt), with 7 interface wires + ground and +5v - Raspberry Pi pins 18,19,21,22,23,24, and 26. The backlight can be PWM controlled with (GPIO18 Raspberry Pi Pin to GP13 Pico) if a [**bridge on the LCD is shorted**](images/BacklightControl1.png).

VolumeMacroPad includes the means to execute a number of Math symbols and Windows or Linux key macros - refer to the layouts in the diagram below. It sets the Pico LED (and shows a small green "C" or "N" or "S") on the LCD, to reflect the state of the Caps-Num-Scroll-lock keys, and adds control of the LCD backlight to dim the display if not used, or set the normal use brightness. It enables a re-calibration of the touch interface, and store it as a preset, and has four layout modes (L1 L2 L3 L4) and four layers A to D, - switch layouts by pressing [L1][L2][L3][L4] or change layers with the the Volume Mute [Vo] key when in Media Key mode. Switch Layers A/D via the Cfg key + ArrowLeft [A-D] key or the option Pad [o]. It also has a 4 page, 108 Math symbols keyboard, which send the standard Unicode symbol characters to the PC. This [**works on Linux Mint with LibreOffice**](images/Libreoffice1.jpg), as well as MSOffice, and use a superset of the key codes from [**Mathboard**](https://github.com/nup002/Mathboard) - refer to the content of **unicode_symbols.h** there. Note that you do not need additional software running on a Windows PC except MS Office. 

Some of the layout, layer, keyboard, and configuration, modes are shown below in the pictures. The pictures shows a page from the Math Keyboard, and Layout 2 - configuration and navigation. Later pictures show the Caps-Num-Sroll-Lock key states as on as shown by the green C, N and S Letters. It is possible to send new text (or control character strings, up to 200 characters long (easily made longer in the program code), to be assigned to keys S1/T1 through to S12/T12 (or M1 - M24), via the Pico's serial USB - start each string with <1 to <6 followed by the string itself to be assigned to the keys - add a > at the end of the string. These strings are saved to the Pico's Flash memory using LittleFS. To enable the string update for layout 4 the screen must be in layout 4, for layout 3 it can be in layout 1, 2 or 3. (For the [M4] key in layout 1 use a <0 at the start of the string.) For each of the two layers A/B the upload will be to the layer that is current i.e. to keys S7 to S12 if layer B is current, and to S1 to S6 if layer A is current. A key auto-repeat that triggers after 500 milliseconds is also implemented - this can be used instead of typing a character repeatedly, or changing the volume by just holding down the Volume Up/Down keys.

Other pictures below, shows the set of seven Media keys, and Layout 1 Layer A [M1] to [M6] programmable macro keys (Layer B would show the Mx keys as M7 to M12). The Volume Mute key is replaced by L1 to L4 in the Config Menu options. It enables faster layout 1 to 4 switching by disabling/enabling the Volume Mute action by pressing the Config and Home keys in sequence. Repeat the same sequence to enable Mute again. The label on the [Vo] key will change to indicate which layout is active L1, L2, L3, or L4. If PageUp is pressed after Config i.e. the [BsD]key, the VolumeUp and VolumeDown keys are replaced by a Delete/Backspace/Tab/Insert and Enter keys. Press [Cfg] + {PgU] again to switch back to the Volume Up and Down keys. If PageDown is pressed after Cfg the startup Layout is toggled between L1 and L2, i.e. the [S1S2] key. If End is pressed after the Cfg key all the text files and config settings are deleted from the Pico's Flash memory, and on restart a re-calibration is done. Note that to save the VolMute/L1-L2 and Vol+Vol-/Delete-Return choices on the Flash memory you have to press Cfg [Sav] key, once more after selecting these two options. This is not necessary for the L1/L2 startup selection. 

Press the small Green Pad on the Right to toggle the Media KeyPad on/off, press the small Red Pad to toggle the Number Keypad on/off, and press the small Blue Pad to toggle the Keyboard (5 sub-pages), on/off.

Using a terminal such as RealTerm it is possible to send non-ASCI characters and numbers instead of just text strings to the six keys labelled T1 to T6 - this may then perform various macro key actions - refer to the first picture in the second set of four images below. Other approaches considered included a decoder for encoded [**duckyscripts**](https://github-wiki-see.page/m/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript), but directly programming these macros seems to be more efficient - refer to the built-in keyboard macro examples below. For example to open the windows snipping tool press open the macro keyboard and goto page 4 then press [GUI][ADD][SHF][ADD][NXT][s][ADD][EXE] - the snipping tool will open. This can then be saved to [M2] by pressing the [Up] button.

The use of *codes to control the interface will also be added as an macro option in the future, and this combined with the chaining of both macro types will
add to the utility of the interface. 

Another way to save large text files or non-ASCII macro files directly in the LittleFS formatted Flash memory of the Pico is described [**here**](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico-littlefs-plugin/blob/master/README.md) and [**here**](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fs.html). You can therefore copy your files (ASCII text or non-ASCII macro files) using the names s01 or t01 through to s24 or t24 directly to the Pico Flash filesystem - see the picture below for a file list.

The keys labelled [Cut], [Cpy], and [Pst] are cut, copy, and paste actions, respectively, and execute the operating system agnostic Control + X, + C, and + V key operations. 

Other example macros are opening an admin UAC powershell [M2] (Note 1 and 4) or admin command prompt [M5]. [M1] is Alt + PrintSceen (Note 2). [M6] opens the Task Manager, and [M3] opens the Run dialog box. It will be easy to convert Layer 2 into a Mouse keys keypad - [**refer to this diagram**](https://github.com/TobiasVanDyk/Pico-MCU-from-Raspberry-Pi/blob/main/TouchLCDst7789Pico/Windows%20Keyboard%20Shortcuts/mouse-keys.jpg).

The keys M1-M24, S1-S24, T1-T24 can also be used to trigger [**AutoHotKey**](https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L) or [**AutoIt**](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) macros, scripts and GUI-shells - but see Note 1 below.

* Note 1 - Because VolumeMacroPad is a trusted device (keyboard) it is able to bypass Windows UAC level 4.
* Note 2 - Some Mini-keyboards do not have a PrintScreen key.
* Note 3 - Microsoft Office Excel still has a functional use for the Scroll-lock.
* Note 4 - The UAC bypass is time sensitive and keydelay3 = 500 may have to be adjusted in the program.


```
(1) Macro Timer Keys time values - default Short Time = 30 seconds and default Long Time 10 minutes. To change Timer
    values send Repeat Macro Timer *mt*num or *mT*num or Oneshot Macro Timer *nt*num or *nT*num where num 0 is
    3 hours t time and 300 hours T time mode. 1 = 30 seconds (2 hours for T) to 9 = 1 hour (48 hours for T). Associate 
    a Macro with a Timer in the KeyBrd Macro Tools Page using key [Tmr] after 1 to 8 have been [ADD]ed to information
    line at the bottom. Then the Source Number Macro will be linked to (1) and (2) Repeat-Timer T and t, (3) and (4)
    Oneshot-Timer T and t, (5) Repeat on Clock Tiem, (6) Oneshot on Clock Time, (7) Repeat Countdown Timer, 
    (8) Oneshot Countdown timer. Ensure that the matching key on the timer keybrd is pressed i.e. if you used 2 then 
    press key [R-t] else the timer will not fire. For a first test use R-t - i.e. select Source macro M01, select 2 
    and press [ADD],[Tmr], exit the Macro KeyBrd, press [Cfg][Mct][R-t].
(2) LCD blank timeout - Send the macro *tb*num with the built-in keyboard where num = 0,1-9 - *tb*0 = 120 hours, 
    *tb*1 = 30 seconds.  
(3) LCD blank dim value - Send the macro *db*num with the built-in keyboard where num = 0,1-9 - *db*0 = no dimming
    - just on/off after blank timeout, and 1-9 = 3 to 30 % PWM instead of blank. 
(4) LCD screen brightness - Send the macro *bb*num with the built-in keyboard where num = 0,1-9 - *bb*0 = full
    brightness and 1-9 = 3 to 50 % PWM brightness.
(5) Power Keys Menu/Command Option - Send the macro *po* with the built-in keyboard to toggle the Power Keys Menu
    option - use the OS Menu (such as GUI+X + U + i,u,r or the run command (such as GUI+R + shutdown + options) command.
    If the Power Menu is active then only the bottom three keys [Rst][Log][Off] and the black Escape key are functional.
(6) Power Keys time values - Default Short Time = 30 seconds and Default Long Time 600 seconds (10 minutes). To change 
    Time values send PowerOff *ot*num or *oT*num or Restart *rt*num or *rT*num where num 0 = 6000 second (100 minutes)
    1 = 30 second (x100 for T) to 9 = 300 second (x100 for T).
(7) Calibration Enable/Disable - Send the macro *ca* with the built-in keyboard to set/clear re-calibration option after 
    a restart to ON or OFF. 
(8) LCD Orientation 180 degree change - Send the macro *ro* with the built-in keyboard - the USB cable will then be on
    the opposite side. This forces a re-calibration on restart. 
(9) Key Font Bold/Normal change - Send the macro *fo* with the built-in keyboard to toggle the labels on the buttons from
    normal to bold.
(a) Key Font White/Black change - Send the macro *fc* with the built-in keyboard to toggle the labels on the buttons from
    white to black.
(b) Macro Copy - Copy a01-a99 to M,S,T keys. Can use *cm* if the SrcNum DstNum is set up - see the four examples 
    above. Else compose *cm*nnXmm via [ADD] where: nn = a01-a99 X = Keys M S T mm = 01-24
(c) Macro Unlink - unlink *ul* with the Macro Key to be unlinked visible as the Source Macro such a Src nn Dst mm. *ua*
    = unlink all macros.
(d) Macro Link Save-Restore On-Off - Linked Macro Data will be lost after a power cycle or reset unless the save-restore 
    option is turned on by executing *lr* command - then also press the black [Cfg] button twice to save the values to 
    flash. An *ld* will send a Link and Macro datadump to the serial port. A save setting for the linked macros do make
    the [Cfg] key slower as well as pressing the [Sav] key - it takes about 1-2 seconds to respond.
(e) To fill M S T 1-24 with hard-coded text string examples send *fm* *fs* *ft* or *fa* (all three) commands. For the
    S keys strings24.h is used and for the T keys stringt24.h is used.
(f) To overwrite and save to Flash M S T keys 1-24 send *sm* *ss* *st* or *sa* (all 3 sets M S T of 24 keys) commands.
    Note that after using *fs,m,t,a* the macros are not automatically saved - it is also necessary to do *sS,m,t,a* to
    save them (and to list their contents).
(g) To delete all macro and config files use "*de*" - will re-calibrate on restart. Remove macro files with the [Rmv] or 
    rename with [Ren] keys
(i) *ct* display four time clocks with a 1 second delay - Time, Macro[R-C][O-C], Macro[Rct][OcT] Power[R-C][O-C].
(j) *0R* Enable/Disable the resistor colour-coded number pad.
(k) *br* = toggle brightness controls up/down replace volume up/dwn for Layouts 1, 3, 4 (not in Layout 2 Cfg). The
    brightness slider usually only has an effect when used in notebook computers not desktops.
(l) *tt* *ta* *tp* *tw* Use *tx*yymmddwhhmm -> *tx*22110341200 12:00am 3 Nov 2022 Thursday where x = t,a,p,w
    t = Main Time/Clock a  = Macro Clock Repeat-Oneshot [R-C][O-C] p = Macro Clock Countdown [RcT][OcT] 
    w = Power Clock [O-C][R-C]. if using [*Cm] only add the numbers yymmddwhhmm w = weekday 0 = Sunday 6 = Saturday  
(m) *xn*number n=1-6, number = 1-20. Top row 3 keys cX-Cut, cC-Copy, cV-Paste: Programmable as x1, x2, x3 Layout 1, 
    and x4, x5, x6 for Layout 3 and 4. 20 options are: Del  Bks  Tab  aTb  Ins  Esc  PrS  aPr  Ret  Snp  Osk  Num  
    Cap  Scr  Cut  Cpy  Pst  Tsk  Run  wX. For example *x1*3 - 1st top-row key in Layout 1 (M) will change from 
    [Cut] to [Tab]. (Press [*Cm] until *x1* shows then press [345] once, press [ADD] press [EXE]) To reset use 
    *x1*0 - will reset all six x1-x6 to Cut, Copy, Paste.
(n) Mouse Cursor and Scroll movement: *m1*nn Scroll amount 1-10 (default 1) and *m2*nn Cursor move amount 1-99 
    (default 5). For example *m2*20 will change the cursor jump movement to 20 from the 5 default.          
(n) Media Key Options: Normally pressing the media key [Cfg] then [Med], only displays the four Media controls 
    Play-Pause, Next, Previous and Stop. To add the Volume Up and Down and the Mute keys press [Cfg][Vol] or 
    [Cfg][1L4]. By using *e1* to *e4* codes the action of this media key can be changed to display the (1) four
    Media Control Keys, (2) add the Volume Up/Down keys to the 4 control keys, (3) add the Mute key to (1) and (2), 
    (4) add the Tone control keys. To disable this additional behaviour use the *e0* command. Note that when 
    the media options (2-4) are enabled using *e2* to *e4*, pressing the media key off, will cancel all the
    other media keys as well - pressing [Cfg][Sav] will save the off state after a reboot else the media keys will
    be active after a reboot. On reboot the setting e0 to e4 is saved i.e. if the [Med] is pressed after a powerup,
    and the e2 setting was previously activated, then both the Volume and Media control keys will show. The single 
    key options [Vol], [1L4] for Volume and Mute are still active when the *en* options are activated but to survive
    a boot the [Cfg]->[Sav] key must then be pressed.
(o) Operating System Option: Use *os*[EXE] to toggle between Windows and Linux. Currently only used for different 
    Restart or PowerOff or Logout options for the [ROf] key. These commands are working in Debian 11.7 but Linux 
    Mint 21.1 and Ubuntu 20.04 steal the focus from the Terminal to the Desktop search box. Note that using these 
    will show passwords as plaintext in the history. Edit ShutDwn1 string and change PASSWORD and USER.
(p) Serial monitoring (via USB) on/off using *se*. A Red/Green "S" will indicate the state (Off/On). Switch the 
    serial on if macros or other text strings are sent to the Touchpad such as DateTime, Foobar Track Info, or 
    HWInfo System Sensors. The state is saved.
(q) Skip first key pressed in LCD in dimmed state - used to wake LCD - toggle on/off with *ks* - the state is saved.
(r) Use *am,s,t*number namely *am*n or *as*n or *at*n with n=1,2,3,4,5 for Keys M S T. Choose between 3 different sets
    of 24 macro actions each, for each set of 24 keys M,S,T Or choose 24 differenr Run or CMD commands with n = 4,5
    n=1 Combination of 6 Notepad Shortcuts + 6 Photoshop Shortcuts + 6 Firefox Shortcuts + 6 MSWord Special Characters
    n=2 24 Windows shortcuts  TskMan  StrtRC Run PCInfo Calc PwerSh FMan TskView WakePC APrtScr MseRClk CtrAltDel 
                              NewFldr Prop   OSK GUI9   GUI6 GUI7   GUI8 GUI0    GUI=   GUIF1   GUI4    GUI5
    n=3 Same set of 24 action that can be used for top row set of 4 keys
    n=4 Set of 24 Windows Run commands
    n=5 Set of 24 Windows Powershell commands
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Math-Greek-Algebra Keyboard:
This is a triple-key macro keyboard with 4 pages and 4 x 9 x 3 = 108 math and Greek algebra
symbols. It is sent to the PC as (hex) Unicode + [ALT] + [x] and can be directly entered into MSWord and in LibreOffice
(also on Linux). The three control keys are [EXE] - send the symbol to the PC, [NXT] - next page of symbols, and [ESC]
go back to the main Config layout - or press the small blue pad again to leave the Math keyboard. Watch out for MSWord 
insisting on capitalising the first letter of a sentence - which will change the first math symbol in a sentence/line 
after a second symbol or letter or enter is typed. 

The [M6] key section in the code has a few examples of using Alt + Number Keypad for Maths and special symbols or 
characters. There are 2 ways to do it - the first is to type the character's Unicode (hex without the 0x or decimal) into 
MSWord and then press [ALT] + [x]. The second method is to hold the Alt key down, then type in a special code number using
the number keypad and then release the Alt key. There are examples of entering the open infinity symbol and the small pi 
symbol in the [M6] key section. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Numeric Keypad    [ BackSpc] [ 7 Spc aA ] [ 8 % bB ] [ 9 xX cC ]  Press 4th Pad - toggle the Number Keypad on/off.
                  [ Return ] [ 4  ,  dD ] [ 5 . eE ] [ 6 =  fF ]  Press 5th Pad - switch Num Pages 1-3 - CapsLock a-A
                  [ 0  + ( ] [ 1  -   ) ] [ 2 *  [ ] [ 3 /   ] ]  *0R* Enable/Disable the resistor colour-code.

To cancel a timed shutdown press the [Stop] key. To exit the Macro Timer or the Power Restart Keypad press any of the
[black] keys or press [Cfg][McT] again. This is also a way to check if any of the timers are running - press [McT] then
press one of the black keys to exit - the display should indicate if a Macro Timer is running or not.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Macro Timer Example:
Program key [M2] with the text hello. Then again from the KeyBrd press [Src] and [Num] until it shows M and 02 as source.
[ADD] a number 1 to 8 - i.e. choose one of the 8 types of timers - for example press [012]3x[ADD]. Then press [NXT][Tmr] 
It will show a message that Macro M02 has been set up for Repeat Timer R-t. If 1 or 3 or 4 had been added then the timer 
used would be Repeat t, Oneshot T, and Oneshot t where t = short time , and T = Long Time. Exit the KeyBrd and press the 
black [Cfg] then [McT] and then make sure to press the same button that have been set up - in this case [R-t]. Open 
notepad and wait for the repeating hello to appear. Note numbers 1-4 are for the countdown timers and numbers 5-8 are used
for the clock timers such as R-C or O-C as discussed below.

Change the timer values with *mt*x *mT*x *nt*x *nT*x where x = 0-9 - you can use the [*Cm] key and [ADD] one number 0-9
then press [EXE].

Currently only single macros from M, S and T 1-24 can be used for the timers - if a chained (linked) macro is used 
it will run the last macro used by the chain. The Timers are programmed as Time-Fire-Time-Fire. There will be an option
later to change this to Fire-Time-Fire-Time for the Repeat timers. The two real-time (using the Pico's HW RTC or Clock)
timers are configured by first setting the Clock Time by sending the string <tyymmddwhhmm> -> <t22110341439> is Thursday
3 Nov 2022 at 14h30. Then set the alarm time by sending the string <ayymmddwhhmm> -> <a22110601439> is Sunday 6 Nov 
2022 at 14h30. To send a repeat macro every 1 minute send <a-1-1-1--1-1> (the double -- is for the day of week not
significant), and associate with it 5 [R-C]. The clock time and alarm time are sent to a serial terminal and displayed
in the status bar by pressing [Cgf] twice. Can use a *code *tx*yymmddwhhmm to send all the clock values else send these
either manually using a serial terminal or use a Proccessing script, or a scheduled task powershell script. Note that 
the Pico has a HW RTC but does not have a dedicated battery backup for its HW RTC.

The Repeat-only mode (i.e send macro fixed number of times with a delay or no delay, is not implemented as yet.

Text Strings: 
Send new text strings up to 200 characters to keys S1/T1 - S12/T24 via USBserial
Start string with <1 to <6 followed by the string assigned to S1/T1-S24/T24 - end string with >
If current Layout is L3 then S1 to S6 changed, Layout L4 T1 to T6 changed, Layout L1 then M1 to M6 changed
If current Layer is A then M1/S1/T1-M6/S6/T6 changed, if Layer B M7/S7/T7-M12/S12/T12 changed etc. 

Example 1: To send the text "This is a string for key [S2]." use a serial terminal to send 
<2This is a string for key [S2].> with Layer 3 visible.
Example 2: Send the macro 0x3C 0x34 0xE0 0xE1 0x29 0x3E (which is <4 Control Shift Escape >), 
with Layer 4 visible, then pressing [M4] will open the Task Manager.

PC Sensor Data: The sensor data read from HWInfo's Gadget Regisry data can be sent to the touchpad and displayed on the
LCD statusbar. The procedure is explained in detail in the MacropadPCSensorData section.

PC Music Playing Data: The Music Playing data read from Foobar2000's Now Playing Simple foobar2000 plugin, can be sent
to the touchpad and displayed on the LCD statusbar. The procedure is explained in detail in the MacropadFoobarPlaying 
section.

Date Time Display This is an alternative Date Time which is only displayed, and not used to set the Pico system 
time-date. The procedure is explained in detail in the SetDateTime section. This uses <T > and the system time date 
uses <t >. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Panic mode reset. If for any reason your keypad becomes unresponsive or behaves strangely reset it as follows:

(1) If the Config button [Cfg] still works press it once and then press the [Del]ete key at the left-hand bottom. Then 
    unplug or reset the keypad. This will delete all files. macros and settings and you should have a re-calibration at
    start-up.
(2) Press either the white button at the bottom and hold it in, then press the black reset button at the back and release
    it (or unplug and re-plug the USB cable instead of the rest button), then only release the white button at the bottom.
    The file manager should show a new storage device named RPI-RP2. Drag and drop any of the code.UF2 files to this 
    device. It will restart after a second or two. If this still does not reset the keypad then instead of the code.UF2 
    file drag and drop the file flash_nuke.uf2, wait a few seconds and then drag the code.UF2 file to the device.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On First Start: 
You will have to do a four-arrow corner calibration - press at the TIP of each arrow just ONCE. If you make a mistake 
and press the same corner twice it is likely that you will need a full reset with the nuke.uf2 file as described above
because the LCD will not pick up the correct buttons being touched.  

The default LCD settings are full brightness and when off full blank. Change these by pressing the second Pad on the 
right (k) or (gray), and then press [NXT]4x (four times), then press [*Cm] once and *bb* shows in staus line at the 
bottom. Then press the [678] key once (6 shows), press [ADD] and then press [EXE]. The normal use LCD Brightness is 
then set to 25 percent. Do the same for the LCD blank setting - press [*Cm] until *db* shows, then press the [345] 
key once (3 shows), then press [ADD] and [EXE] - this sets the blank LCD to 10 percent brightness when in sleep mode.

You can also increase the elapsed time period before the display dims - change it from the default 30 seconds to 300
seconds by selecting *tb* using the [*Cm] key, then press the [678] key once (6), and then press [ADD] and [EXE]. 
When the LCD has dimmed or blanked a first keypress is ignored - it is used to restore the LCD to its selected 
brightness before acting on the keypress.

The Volume Up and Down keys [V+] and [V-], are on by the default on a first start. To display the first of another set 
of 20 options (Del  Bks  Tab aTb  Ins  Esc  PrS  aPr  Ret  Snp  Osk  Num  Cap  Scr  Cut  Cpy  Pst  Tsk  Run  wX), 
disable the volume key by pressing [Cfg] then the grey [Vol] to toggle the Volume keys on/off. (This setting is saved
automatically.) Then optionally, press [Cfg] and [Var] to choose from the other 20 options for the Top Right hand key. 

Linked macros are not saved by default (but restoring saved linked-macro configuration is always on). To turn it on 
(and off) execute *lr* command via the KeyBrd on the Cfg Page. When on it slows the response when pressing the [Cfg] and 
[Sav] key - it may be acceptable to turn the links save off (*lr*) once links have been programmed.

Another use of the two main layouts could be to have one customised for Linux - although all the keys in layout 1 and 2 except the run dialog, and the powershell and command prompt, function the same under Linux.

The list of key names that can be used is in TinyUSB stack's hid.h, as included here. Use the configuration descrition as shown below to set up the TFT_eSPI driver. The sampled calibration data can be adjusted - see the comments in the program for instructions. Compile with the USB stack set to TinyUSB not PicoSDK. 

Specify the display and touch gpio in User_Setup.h (included [**here**](User_Setup.h)).

```
#define RPI_DISPLAY_TYPE // 20MHz maximum SPI works with waveshare serial to parallel displays

#define ILI9486_DRIVER
#define TFT_INVERSION_ON

#define TFT_BL   13            // LED back-light control pin
