New changes:
Serial monitoring (via USB) on/off using *se*. A Red/Green "S" will indicate the state (Off/On). The serial monitor sometimes hangs during 
boot to a Windows OS. The default is off which prevents this. Switch the serial on if macros or other text strings are sent to the Touchpad
such as DateTime, Foobar Track Info, or HWInfo System Sensors. This setting is not saved.

Previous changes:
Operating System Option: Use *os*[EXE] to toggle between Windows, Linux, and Raspberry Pi OS. Currently only used for different Restart
or PowerOff or Logout options for the [ROf] key. These commands are working in Debian 11.7 but PiOS, Mint 21.1 and Ubuntu 22 sometimes
steal the focus from the Terminal to the Desktop search box. An alternative using Alt+F2 (Runbox) is presented at the end of the code 
section. Note that using these will show passwords as plaintext in the history. For Linux edit ShutDwn1 string and change PASSWORD and
USER.
There are now two string header files strings24.h for the S keys and stringt24.h for the T keys. Load these using *fs* *ft* and 
save them to flash using *ss* and *st*.
Date Time Display: This is alternative Date Time which is only displayed not used to set the Pico system time-date.
The procedure is explained in detail in the SetDateTime section.
Can now choose Layout 1,2,3 or 4 as the startup Layer - press [Cfg][1S4] repeatedly.
Fixed issue with A,B,C,D layer letter display
PC Music Playing Data: The Music Playing data read from Foobar2000's Now Playing Simple foobar2000 plugin, can be sent
to the touchpad and displayed on the LCD statusbar. The procedure is explained in detail in the MacropadFoobarPlaying section.
PC Sensor Data: The sensor data read from HWInfo's Gadget Regisry data can be sent to the touchpad and displayed on the
LCD statusbar. The procedure is explained in detail in the MacropadPCSensorData section.
Media Key Options: Previously pressing the media key [Cfg] then [Med], only displays the four Media controls Play-Pause, Next, 
Previous and Stop. To add the Volume Up and Down and the Mute keys press [Cfg][Vol] or [Cfg][1L4]. 
Using the four new *e1* to *e4* codes the action of this media key can be changed to display the (1) four Media Control Keys, 
(2) add the Volume Up/Down keys to the 4 control keys, (3) add the Mute key to (1) and (2), (4) add the Tone control keys. 
To disable this additional behaviour use the *e0* command. 
Change and save Mouse Cursor and Scroll movement: *m1*nn Scroll amount 1-10 (default 1) and *m2*nn Cursor move amount 1-99 (default 5). 
For example *m2*20 will change the cursor jump movement to 20 from the 5 default.
Mouse Keyboard:
When in Layer 2 - press middle pad [u] to toggle Mouse KeyBoard on/off - these are 12 mouse buttons,
scroll, and cursor movement keys:
[LBt]   [Up]  [RBt]   [Sc+]    [Left-Button]   [Cursor-Up]    [Right-Button]   [Scroll-Up]
[ < ]  [MBt]  [ > ]   [L2x]    [Cursor-Left] [Middle-Button]  [Cursor-Right] [Double-Left-Click]
[Bck]  [Dwn]  [Fwd]   [Sc-]    [Back-Button]  [Cursor-Down]  [Forward-Button]  [Scroll-Dwn]
Note that a Mouse Right-click can be also programmed as a Shift and F10.
Colour Scheme Changes
Added option for double ** to process strings starting with *
Added comment to end a shorter string that replaces a longer string with NULL char - press [GUI]3x and [ADD] at end of shorter string



Compiled with new Pico SDK 1.5, TinyUSB 2.20, Arduino Pico 3.20, TFTeSPI 2.50, and Adafruit GFX 1.11.5

To install new version of Arduino Pico first delete it from boards manager, then delete the folder 
C:\Users\Name\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\rp2040 then close and reopen Arduino IDE and then add the new Arduino Pico Board.

NB: Use 2MB Flash option -> 1:1 Flash Pgm:File Split -> Will (possibly) loose all data and start with new calibration
    Use Adafruit TinyUSB
