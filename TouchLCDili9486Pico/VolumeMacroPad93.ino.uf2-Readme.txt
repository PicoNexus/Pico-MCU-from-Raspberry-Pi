New changes:
NB: Corrected twice: for (n=0; n<6; n++) keycode[6] = 0x00; -> for (n=0; n<6; n++) keycode[n] = 0x00; Not yet compiled.
Change and save Mouse Cursor and Scroll movement: *m1*nn Scroll amount 1-10 (default 1) and *m2*nn Cursor move amount 1-99 (default 5). 
For example *m2*20 will change the cursor jump movement to 20 from the 5 default.

Previous changes:
Mouse Keyboard:
When in Layer 2 - press middle pad [u] to toggle Mouse KeyBoard on/off - these are 12 mouse buttons,
scroll, and cursor movement keys:
[LBt]   [Up]  [RBt]   [Sc+]    [Left-Button]   [Cursor-Up]    [Right-Button]   [Scroll-Up]
[ < ]  [MBt]  [ > ]   [L2x]    [Cursor-Left] [Middle-Button]  [Cursor-Right] [Double-Left-Click]
[Bck]  [Dwn]  [Fwd]   [Sc-]    [Back-Button]  [Cursor-Down]  [Forward-Button]  [Scroll-Dwn]
Note that a Mouse Right-click can be also programmed as a Shift and F10.
Colour Scheme Changes
Added option for double ** to process strings starting with *
Added comment to end a shorter string that replaces a longer string with NULL char - press [GUI]3x and [ADD] at end of shorter string



Compiled with new Pico SDK 1.5, TinyUSB 2.10, Arduino Pico 3.11, TFTeSPI 2.50, and Adafruit GFX 1.11.5

To install new version of Arduino Pico first delete it from boards manager, then delete the folder C:\Users\Name\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\rp2040 then close and reopen Arduino IDE and then add the new Arduino Pico Board.

NB: Use 2MB Flash option -> 1:1 Flash Pgm:File Split -> Will (possibly) loose all data and start with new calibration
    Use Adafruit TinyUSB
