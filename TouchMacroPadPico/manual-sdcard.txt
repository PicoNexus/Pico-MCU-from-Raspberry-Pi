[Cut][Copy][Paste][Delete][Enter] are 5 keys that can be assigned from 52 options:
1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19 20  21  22 - 27  28 - 52

28-52 K1-K6. Keys K1-K6 can be associated with a macrostring definition: Keys K1 to K24 read the content of files 
K01Link to K24Link (selectable from the SDCard and/or flash memory), which contains a list of 3-letter file names
containing macro definitions and/or text strings, such as a01-a99, m01-m24, s01-s24, t01-t24 or any other 3-letter
name, to be executed in sequence, with separately defined repetitions and delays.

For example, the file K01Link contains the text a50a51a52n. Assign this file which is hard-linked to key K1 to one 
of the top row 3 keys and when pressed it will execute the contents of three macro and/or text files: a50: GUI r, 
a51: "notepad", and a52: Ctrl + increase size. Select which K01Link file pressing K1 will execute by selecting the 
SDCard or FlasMem through the 8-cycle A-D Layer - when white it uses the Flashmemory, and when orange the SDCard. 
This text file list of files to execute can also be used for all 72 keys M1-M24, S1-S24, T1-T24, or they can 
execute the individual macros, or text strings, selectively.

Repeat and Delay are controlled by the characters r, R, and d, D respectively:

 Repeat rnn = repeat 01=1 to 99=99 times the next macro    - r03a01 repeat a01 3x
 Repeat Rnn = repeat 01=100 to 9900 times the next macro   - R03a01 repeat a01 300x
 Repeat RRn = repeat 1=10000 to 90000 times the next macro - RR3a01 repeat a01 30000x
 Use rnna01 = repeat a01 nn times and not a01rnn as in DuckyScript
  
 Delay ddn - delay 0=100 to 9=900 milliseconds - dd3a01 delay 300 milliseconds before a01 executed
 Delay dnn - delay 01=1  to 99=99 seconds      - d03a01 delay 3 seconds before a01 executed
 Delay Dnn - delay 01=1  to 99=99 minutes      - D03a01 delay 3 minutes before a01 executed
 Delay DDn - delay 1=1   to 9=9 hours          - DD3a01 delay 3 hours before a01 executed
           
These 5 keys can also be programmed through starcodes x1, x2, x3 Layout 1, x4, x5, x6 for Layout 3 and 4, and
x7 and x8 for the [Del] and [Ret] keys. They can use any of the 52 actions for x1 - x8. Program as *xn*number 
n=1-8, number = 1-52.

Press [Cfg] once, and then press [Key] once or twice, to select 52 options for either the [Del] or the [Ret] 
key which are then selected by pressing the red bottom Pad [o] which will cycle through the 52 options for both the 
[Del]ete key top right and the [Ret]urn key bottom right. Pressing the [Key] key 3x, 4x or 5x times will select the 
Layer 1 [Cut], second [Cpy], or third [Pst] key respectively which can then be changed by pressing the bottom Pad 
i.e. option [o]. Pressing the [Key] key, 6x, 7x, or 8x will select this top-row 3 keys in Layouts 3 or 4, which
can then be changed to one of the 52 options using the bottom Pad key. The status line will show which key is chosen
and which option is selected. To save the choice press the [Sav] key just below it, else it will reset to the 
default [Del], [Ret], [Cut,Copy,Paste] keys after the next reboot. If the [Sav] key is not pressed the new 
choice(s) will be valid for current session only. To reset the keys to their default options, use the *x1*0 code 
i.e. by pressing the second Pad [k], and then press [*Cm] until *x1* shows, then press [012] once, then press 
[ADD][EXE].

The key M1-M24 macros listed above are default macros - use the macro editor to configure new macros or copy, 
rename and/or make linkfiles for new or existing macros. Some of the default macros run items on the pinned on the 
taskbar, and are indicated by GuiL + Key0 - Key9 etc in macroBanks.h WinMacro content.

The 8-cycle [A-D] key in Layout 2: If the A-D indicator shows a white A, B. C, or D then the Layouts 
Mx Sx Tx use FlashMem macrofiles or linkfiles, or the actions assigned with *fm* *fs* *ft* strings. If the indicator
is orange then then the Layouts Mx Sx Tx use the SDCard files or the Coded functions. To save the A-D (orange or 
white) choices press [Sav] else the currently saved choice will be used after the next reboot. Note that the A-D page
chosen using the Pad keys [a] or [d] are not saved between a reboot - you must use [Cfg][A-D][Sav] sequence to save 
both White/Orange[A-D] state.

Connecting a PC serial monitor to the TouchPad and pressing [Cfg] twice i.e. press [Cfg][Sav] will list all the files
on both the FlasMem and SDCard filesystems. Delete a file by constructing its name in the Macro-editor, and then 
press [Rmv] remove.

The sequence in choosing what to do when the keys M1-M24, S1-S24, T1-T24 are pressed is as shown below:

if S Keys Page 3: Keys S1-S24
   if Orange A-D Do SDCard large text files   - if ok exit
   if White A-D Do FlashMem Macro-definitions - if ok exit else Do FlashMem Macro-Link actions - if ok exit
   if Orange A-D Do SDCard Macro-Link actions - if ok exit else Do SDCard Macro-definitions    - if ok exit              
   Do S-keys actions as defined in Bank123
                  
if T or M Keys Pages 1 or 4: Keys M1-M24 or T1-T24
   if White A-D Do FlashMem Macro-definitions - if ok exit else Do FlashMem Macro-Link actions - if ok exit
   if Orange A-D Do SDCard Macro-Link actions - if ok exit else Do SDCard Macro-definitions    - if ok exit              
   Do M,T-keys actions as defined in Bank123

Keys [M2] and [M5] show additional options based on Layer state A-D: They run an admin Command Prompt and 
admin Powershell respectively, only in Layer A, and do M-key Bank123 actions if not in Layer A. 

SDCard Filenames accessed by S keys [S1]-[S24] and selectable by [Cfg][Opt] or with *sd*n are:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: The Macro Destination [Dst] is also referred to as the Target Macro here in some cases.

Note: To choose between Macro A = 1 to 99 does not require 99 key-presses - just hold the [Num] key down for key-repeat
It cycles through 1-99 in about 5 seconds.

Note: If a shorter string replaces a longer string end the shorter string with a NULL char - press [GUI]3x and then 
press [ADD] at the end of shorter string. For example Key [S2] contains "notepad" which is 7 chars. To replace it with
*188# select [S2] as the destination, press [Dst] then [Num] until 02 shows, then press [*=/], press [ADD], press [*=/]
and [ADD] again (** is not treated as special command but as the chr *), then press [012]2x[ADD], [678]3x[ADD], again 
[678]3x[ADD], [Sym]2x[ADD], [NXT]2x, [GUI]3x[ADD], then press [EXE] and then the [Up] key to save.
                                                                          
The keyboard has 5 pages - most with 9 triple function keys, and 3 control keys [EXE] [NXT] [ADD]. For example page 1 
has keys [abc], [def], to [y,z,space]. To select a or b or c press the abc key once, twice or thrice - to add it to a 
new macro press the ADD key else press another character-symbol modifier key or press [NXT] for the next keyboard page. 

Press Pad 2 again to leave the keyboard or press [EXE] to send the macro to the PC and save to the (Source-Destination)
or SD Macro Key as indicated by the second number 1 to 24. Change the target number by pressing the [Dst] then the [Num]
key. The macro is saved when the Up-Arrow key is pressed after the [EXE] key. Refer to the examples below on how to copy
commands between the KeyBrd macros (a01-a99 files), and the 3 sets of 24 keys M, S, T files s01-s24, m01-m24, t01-t24.

The macros on page 5 are modifiers (simultaneously pressed keys) such as Control + Alt + Delete + GUI (maximum of 6 keys
in macro). To send this sequence press [CTR][ADD][ALT][ADD][SHF]x3 (3 times for delete)[ADD][EXE]. 

To open the windows snipping tool press [GUI][ADD][SHF][ADD][NXT][s][ADD][EXE] - the snipping tool will open. This can 
then be saved to [M2] by pressing the [Up] button. 

To send a sequence such as [WinKey] + "r" press [GUI][ADD][NXT][pqr]x3[ADD][EXE]. To assign Alt + PrintScr to key [M2]
press [NXT]4x[ALT][ADD][ALT]3x[ADD][EXE} and [Up] to save. Alt + PScr is then executed when pressing [M2]. 

Another example: [GUI][ADD][NXT]1x[r][EXE][Up] then press [n][ADD][o][ADD][t][ADD][e][ADD][p][ADD][a][ADD][d][ADD] 
[NXT]3x[CRF][ADD][NXT][h][ADD][e][ADD][l][ADD][l][ADD][e][ADD][EXE][Up]. After this press just two keys [M2][M1] to 
open notepad and insert the text "hello". To make the text larger [CTR][ADD][NXT]3x[9+-]2x to make the text larger.

Toggle the sticky keys: Press [SHF][ADD] 5 times then press [EXE] and save to key [M2]. (For a complete macro add 
[C/R] [ADD] key at the end of this sequence.) 

The option to use the combined modifier bit instead of a modifier byte, is used in the top row Cut-Copy-Paste keys, and
also for some of the pre-programmed examples for the M1-M24 keys. 

Macros sent to the PC from the built-in keyboard can also be saved to file aX X = 01-99. Press [Up] after sending the 
macros to the PC to assign them to the [M,S,T X]key. 

To set it up at first (displays red xx = Src Num Dst Num) press [Src] once then [Dst] - it will now show M01 M01 i.e.
the source and destination macro is M1 and M1. 

Note: The [Cpy] key on page 4 is now the most direct way to copy the [Src][Num] to [Dst][Num] Macro. The alternative is
the starcode *cm* = [Cpy] macro source->dest. 
      
Example 1: Set up M01 M04 as SrcNum DstNum - then press [CTR][SHF][TEI]2x[EXE][UP] - press [Up] to save to key Target
          (Destination) key [M4]. Press [M4] and the (Windows) Task-Manager opens (Ctrl+Shft+Esc).
Example 2: Set up M01 M01 - press [GUI][r][EXE][Up] - save to key [M1] - file list shows two files a01 and m01 - both
           3 bytes length - setup Source M01 then press [Lst] it shows E3 15 00 which are in hexadecimal [GUI][r][NULL]
           Copy M01 to Key [S4] - Set up M01 S04 then  press [Cpy]. Press [M4] to test and setup SrcNum S04 then press
           [Lst] - E3 15 00 00 (one 0x00 added). Press key [S4] to open the run window.
Example 3: Set up A01 S01 - then [Cpy] - file list has s01 4 press [S1] open run command window
Example 4: Set up A04 S02 - then [Cpy] - file list has s02 5 press [S2] open TaskMan
Example 5: Set up S04 M04 - press [GUI][r][EXE][Up] - press [S4] to open run window
           Set up M04 S02 - then [Cpy] - press [S2] open run windows 
Example 6: Set up A04 T07 - Rename a04 (must exist) to t07 - press [Ren] - then press [T7]

Linking Macro Examples: Linking is done through a textfile list of 3-letter filenames in sequence. For example the file
M01Link on the SDCard has text a50a51a52a51a52a52a52 Pressing key [M1] with an orange A-D, will then execute macro files
a50(GUI r), a51("notepad") a52(Ctrl +) a51("notepad") a52(Ctrl +) a52(Ctrl +) a52(Ctrl +)

This applies to all three keysets M, S and T but M is used in the example below.

Keys M1-M24 read the content of files M01Link-M24Link on SDCard/FlashMem which contains: 3-letter filesname on flash
memory such as a01-a99 (read in groups of 3 bytes = filename) Create file M01Link using the Macro Editor: Setup m01
as Target, then create a50a51a52 using [ADD]. Then press [Lnk] and file M01Link will be created on the SDCard if
A-D is orange or in FlashMem if A-D is white (FlashMem is case-sensitive => two files named m01Link and M01Link 
can be present at the same time.)

Example 1: Program [M1] with a Open Run windows [GUI][r] 
           Program [M2] with a notepad+C/R
           Program [M3] with hello+C/R
           Program [M4] with [CTR][SHF][Esc] Open Taskman
           
           Then set up SrcNum DstNum M01 M02 - Press Link [Lnk], then press [M1] it opens the run window, and then opens
           notepad. Set up M01 M03 - Press Link [Lnk], then press [M1] it opens the run window, then runs notepad, then
           enter text "hello" in Notepad. Again repeat above line - it should write hello twice when pressing key [M1]
           
           If no number is added via [012][345][678][9][ADD] then keys [M1][S1][T1] are used as the default with the Src
           determining whether it is M, S, or T and the DstNumber determining which macro number a01-a99 are added. If 
           a number is added for example 5, then those SrcNumbers [M5][S5][T5] are used as the key to run the macro (or
           linked macros).
           
Example 2: Program M1 and M4 (GUI+r and Ctr+Shf+Esc) i.e. M01 M04. Then go to the numbers page and add 5 i.e. press 
           [345[3x[ADD] then goto the Macro Tools page where M01 M04 is still visible and press [Lnk]. Key [M5] (not 
           keys [M1] or [M4]), will then open the Run window, and then also open the TaskMan. 
Example 3: Setup Source S04 and Target M02, and do not add any numbers - press [Lnk] - will then link files a04 and a02
           to key [S1].
Example 4: Setup Source M04 Target M02, and do not add any numbers - press [Lnk] - will then link files a02 and a02 to
           key [M1] i..e pressing key [M1] will run the macro in file a02 twice. Repeat this again, and the number of 
           times will increase by one each time. 
                
F1-F24 keys are all one key [Fnn] and are sent as keycodes (simultaneous) and not keypress types - to send [F3] open
the macro keyboard then press [NXT]2x[Fnn]3x[ADD][EXE]. Press [Up] to assign it to a [Dst][Num] key.

The Keyboard has a Direct (to PC) Mode - use the Yellow Options Pad on the bottom right, to switch Direct Mode On/Off.
A Blue "D" indicator will show if it is on. Any character selected (shows in status bar), will be sent to the PC by 
pressing [EXE] - [ADD] is not necessary. If a character or more than one characters have been [ADD]ed they will only 
be sent after Direct Mode is switched off.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Keyboard can be used to change various options by sending *option*value commands. If a number(s) is needed after
the second * then pressing [ADD] is required. The [*Cm] key can also be used and then pressing the [Add] key after
the last * is not necessary. All *Codes return to same *Code with [*Cm] if [EXE] was pressed. *Codes are incremented 
to the next starcode if no [EXE} pressed. The main codes are listed below:

(1) Macro Timer Keys time values - default Short Time = 30 seconds and default Long Time 10 minutes. To change Timer
    values send Repeat Macro Timer *mt*num or *mT*num or Oneshot Macro Timer *nt*num or *nT*num where num 0 is
    3 hours t time and 300 hours T time mode. 1 = 30 seconds (2 hours for T) to 9 = 1 hour (48 hours for T). Associate 
    a Macro with a Timer in the KeyBrd Macro Tools Page using key [Tmr] after 1 to 8 have been [ADD]ed to information
    line at the bottom. Then the Source Number Macro will be linked to (1) and (2) Repeat-Timer T and t, (3) and (4)
    Oneshot-Timer T and t, (5) Repeat on Clock Tiem, (6) Oneshot on Clock Time, (7) Repeat Countdown Timer, 
    (8) Oneshot Countdown timer. Ensure that the matching key on the timer keybrd is pressed i.e. if you used 2 then 
    press key [R-t] else the timer will not fire. For a first test use R-t - i.e. select Source macro M01, select 2 
    and press [ADD],[Tmr], exit the Macro KeyBrd, press [Cfg][Mct][R-t].
(2) LCD blank timeout - Send the macro *tb*num with the built-in keyboard where num = 0,1-9 - *tb*0 = 120 hours, 
    *tb*1 = 30 seconds.  
(3) LCD blank dim value - Send the macro *db*num with the built-in keyboard where num = 0,1-9 - *db*0 = no dimming
    - just on/off after blank timeout, and 1-9 = 3 to 30 % PWM instead of blank. 
(4) LCD screen brightness - Send the macro *bb*num with the built-in keyboard where num = 0,1-9 - *bb*0 = full
    brightness and 1-9 = 3 to 50 % PWM brightness.
(5) Power Keys Menu/Command Option - Send the macro *po* with the built-in keyboard to toggle the Power Keys Menu
    option - use the OS Menu (such as GUI+X + U + i,u,r or the run command (such as GUI+R + shutdown + options) command.
    If the Power Menu is active then only the bottom three keys [Rst][Log][Off] and the black Escape key are functional.
(6) Power Keys time values - Default Short Time = 30 seconds and Default Long Time 600 seconds (10 minutes). To change 
    Time values send PowerOff *ot*num or *oT*num or Restart *rt*num or *rT*num where num 0 = 6000 second (100 minutes)
    1 = 30 second (x100 for T) to 9 = 300 second (x100 for T).
(7) Calibration Enable/Disable - Send the macro *ca* with the built-in keyboard to set/clear re-calibration option after 
    a restart to ON or OFF. 
(8) LCD Orientation 180 degree change - Send the macro *ro* with the built-in keyboard - the USB cable will then be on
    the opposite side. This forces a re-calibration on restart. 
(9) Key Font Bold/Normal change - Send the macro *fo* with the built-in keyboard to toggle the labels on the buttons 
    from normal to bold.
(a) Key Font White/Black change - Send the macro *fc* with the built-in keyboard to toggle the labels on the buttons 
    from white to black.
(b) Macro Copy - Copy a01-a99 to M,S,T keys. Can use *cm* if the SrcNum DstNum is set up - see the four examples 
    above. Else compose *cm*nnXmm via [ADD] where: nn = a01-a99 X = Keys M S T mm = 01-24
(c) Macro Unlink - unlink *ul* with the Macro Key to be unlinked visible as the Source Macro such a Src nn Dst mm. 
    (*ua* unlink all macros - not yet implemented)
(d) Macro Link Save-Restore On-Off - *lr* - not sensible anymore - change to be implemented
(e) To fill M S T 1-24 with hard-coded text string examples send *fm* *fs* *ft* or *fa* (all three) commands. For the
    S keys strings24.h is used and for the T keys stringt24.h is used.
(f) To overwrite and save to Flash M S T keys 1-24 send *sm* *ss* *st* or *sa* (all 3 sets M S T of 24 keys) commands.
    Note that after using *fs,m,t,a* the macros are not automatically saved - it is also necessary to do *sS,m,t,a* to
    save them (and to list their contents in part).
(g) To delete all macro and config files use "*de*" - will re-calibrate on restart. Remove macro files with the [Rmv] 
    or rename with [Ren] keys
(i) *ct* display four time clocks with a 1 second delay - Time, Macro[R-C][O-C], Macro[Rct][OcT] Power[R-C][O-C].
(j) *0R* Enable/Disable the resistor colour-coded number pad.
(k) *br* = toggle brightness controls up/down replace volume up/dwn for Layouts 1, 3, 4 (not in Layout 2 Cfg). The
    brightness slider usually only has an effect when used in notebook computers not desktops.
(l) *tt* *ta* *tp* *tw* Use *tx*yymmddwhhmm -> *tx*22110341200 12:00am 3 Nov 2022 Thursday where x = t,a,p,w
    t = Main Time/Clock a  = Macro Clock Repeat-Oneshot [R-C][O-C] p = Macro Clock Countdown [RcT][OcT] 
    w = Power Clock [O-C][R-C]. if using [*Cm] only add the numbers yymmddwhhmm w = weekday 0 = Sunday 6 = Saturday  
(m) *xn*number n=1-8, number = 1-52. Top row 3 keys cX-Cut, cC-Copy, cV-Paste: Programmable as x1, x2, x3 Layout 1, 
    and x4, x5, x6 for Layout 3 and 4. 52 options are: Del Bks Tab aTb Ins Esc PrS aPr Ret Snp Osk Num Cap Scr Cut
    Cpy Pst Tsk Run wX CPi Ts1-Ts6 K1-K24. For example *x1*3 - 1st top-row key in Layout 1 (M) will change from [Cut]
    to [Tab]. (Press [*Cm] until *x1* shows then press [345] once, press [ADD] press [EXE]) To reset use *x1*0 
    will reset all six x1-x6 to Cut, Copy, Paste. Or *x4*6 - 1st top-row key in Layouts 2 and 3 [S] and [T] keys,
    will change from [Cut] to [Esc]. To reset use *x1*0 - will reset all six x1-x6 to the default Cut, Copy,and 
    Paste. Use *x7*n=1-52 for [Del]ete key changes and *x8*n=1-52 for [Ret]urn key changes.
(n) Mouse Cursor and Scroll movement: *m1*nn Scroll amount 1-10 (default 1) and *m2*nn Cursor move amount 1-99 
    (default 5). For example *m2*20 will change the cursor jump movement to 20 from the 5 default.          
(o) Media Key Options: Normally pressing the media key [Cfg] then [Med], only displays the four Media controls 
    Play-Pause, Next, Previous and Stop. To add the Volume Up and Down and the Mute keys press [Cfg][Vol] or 
    [Cfg][Vo]. By using *e1* to *e4* codes the action of this media key can be changed to display the (1) four
    Media Control Keys, (2) add the Volume Up/Down keys to the 4 control keys, (3) add the Mute key to (1) and (2), 
    (4) add the Tone control keys. To disable this additional behaviour use the *e0* command. Note that when 
    the media options (2-4) are enabled using *e2* to *e4*, pressing the media key off, will cancel all the
    other media keys as well. To save the media keys press [Cfg] then [Sav] then after a reboot the setting e0 to
    e4 is saved i.e. if the [Med] is pressed after a powerup, and the e2 setting was previously activated, then 
    both the Volume and Media control keys will show. The single key options [Vol], [Vo] for Volume and Mute are
    still active when the *en* options are activated.
(p) Operating System Option: Use *os*[EXE] to toggle between Windows and Linux. Currently only used for different 
    Restart or PowerOff or Logout options for the [ROf] key. These commands are working in Debian 11.7 but Linux 
    Mint 21.1 and Ubuntu 20.04 steal the focus from the Terminal to the Desktop search box. Note that using these 
    will show passwords as plaintext in the history. Edit ShutDwn1 string and change PASSWORD and USER.
(q) Serial monitoring (via USB) on/off using *se*. A Red/Green square [LED] in the top-left will indicate the state
    (Off/On). Switch the serial on if macros or other text strings are sent to the Touchpad such as DateTime, 
    Foobar2000 Track Info, or HWInfo System Sensors. The state is saved.
(r) Skip first key pressed in LCD in dimmed state - used to wake LCD - toggle on/off with *ks* - the state is saved.
(s) Use SDCard files: When in S (Layer L3), press [s] Pad so that A,B,C,D change from white (FlashMem) to orange 
    (SDCard). Keys [S1] to [S24] then send text SDCard files as keyboard characters to PC - the size of the strings
    are only limited by the SDCard capacity. Change between 21 SDCard file-sets of 24 files each with *sd*n where
    n=1-9, m.s,t a-g, k,K. For example *sd*2[ADD][EXE] enables the second set of files. The folder SDCardFiles has
    a set of example files. Change back to regular [S1]-[S24] key strings by pressing [s] Pad again to a white A-D.
    Use *sd*0 - i.e. select *sd* with [*Cm] then press 0[ADD][EXE] - to disable the SDCard text files function. 
    Re-enable with *sd*n. If a new SDCard is inserted it may require pressing the hardware reset button of the 
    TouchLCD once. SDCard filenames are listed above in manual.h or in sdcard.h
(t) Bank123 options: Use *am,s,t*number namely *am*n or *as*n or *at*n with n=1,2,3,4,5 for Keys M S T. For n = 1,2,3
    choose between 3 different sets of 24 macro actions each, for each set of 24 keys M,S,T or choose 24 different
    Run or CMD commands with n = 4,5. Note that pressing WinKeyLeft = [GuiL] + [number key] such as [GUI1], [GUI2] 
    etc will run the 1st, 2nd etc.items pinned to the taskbar.
    n=1 Combination of 6 Notepad Shortcuts + 6 Photoshop Shortcuts + 6 Firefox Shortcuts + 6 MSWord Special Characters
    n=2 24 Windows shortcuts: TskMan  StrtRC Run PCInfo Calc PwerSh FMan TskView WakePC APrtScr MouseRClk CtrAltDel

    n=3 Same set of 24 actions that can be used for top row set of 4 keys and the [Del [Ret] keys:
    Del Bks Tab aTb Ins Esc PrS aPr Ret Snp Osk Num Cap Scr Cut Cpy Pst Tsk Run wX CPi Ts1 Ts2 Ts3
    n=4 Set of 24 Windows Run commands
    n=5 Set of 24 Windows Powershell commands
    [LED] Indicator for MacroBank Selected in Layouts 1 3 4 = Orange,Green,Blue,Yellow,White
(u) *r0* Reset LCD - reboot after 2 seconds delay. 
    *r1* toggle action - enable/disable Reset-Once-On-Start
    *r2* Reboot the RP2040 into USB UF2 upload mode - can cancel press HW Reset within 5 seconds
    *r3* Enable double-tap hardware reset button, will then resstart to the UF2 USB bootloader (only for one session)
(v) *bl* toggle Black Key function on Powerkeys page - switch backlight on/off - enable/disable with *bl* To use 
    this first send *bl*[EXE] code then in Layer2 press [Cfg][ROf], and then press the Black Key (press twice the very 
    first time), to the switch backlight off - press on the same place of blank screen to switch the screen on again. 
    For PC's who supply USB power after switchoff this could be used to blank the LCD  screen after pressing one of the
    Power Keys for switch off. If disabled with *bl* pressing the black key will just exit the Power Keys screen.
(w) Key Held Duration: *kr*num with num = 1-9 or 100-900 msec key press wait duration before repeat.
(x) Key Held Enable: *ke* Enable/Disable Volume Mute Processing if [Vo][L1-L4 key is long-pressed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Symbols-SpecialChar-Math-Greek-Algebra Keyboard: 
Press Pad [s]. This is a triple-key macro keyboard with 4 pages and 4 x 9 x 3 = 108 Special characters, Math/Algebra, and
Greek symbols. It is sent to the PC as (hex) Unicode + [ALT] + [x] and can be directly entered into MSWord and in 
LibreOffice (also on Linux). The three control keys are [EXE] - send the symbol to the PC, [NXT] - next page of symbols, 
and [ESC] go back to the main Config layout - or press the small blue pad again to leave the Symbols keyboard. Watch out 
for MSWord insisting on capitalising the first letter of a sentence - which will change the first math symbol in a sentence
or line after a second symbol or letter or enter is typed. 

The [M6] key section in the code has a few examples of using Alt + Number Keypad for Maths and special symbols or 
characters. There are 2 ways to do it - the first is to type the character's Unicode (hex without the 0x or decimal) into 
MSWord and then press [ALT] + [x]. The second method is to hold the Alt key down, then type in a special code number using
the number keypad and then release the Alt key. There are examples of entering the open infinity symbol and the small pi 
symbol in the [M6] key section. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Numeric Keypad    [ BackSpc] [ 7 Spc aA ] [ 8 % bB ] [ 9 xX cC ]  Press 4th Pad - toggle the Number Keypad on/off.
                  [ Return ] [ 4  ,  dD ] [ 5 . eE ] [ 6 =  fF ]  Press 5th Pad - switch Num Pages 1-3 - CapsLock a-A
                  [ 0  + ( ] [ 1  -   ) ] [ 2 *  [ ] [ 3 /   ] ]  *0R* Enable/Disable the resistor colour-code.

To cancel a timed shutdown press the [Stop] key. To exit the Macro Timer or the Power Restart Keypad press any of the
[black] keys or press [Cfg][McT] again. This is also a way to check if any of the timers are running - press [McT] then
press one of the black keys to exit - the display should indicate if a Macro Timer is running or not.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Macro Timer Example:
Program key [M2] with the text hello. Then again from the KeyBrd press [Src] and [Num] until it shows M and 02 as source.
[ADD] a number 1 to 8 - i.e. choose one of the 8 types of timers - for example press [012]3x[ADD]. Then press [NXT][Tmr] 
It will show a message that Macro M02 has been set up for Repeat Timer R-t. If 1 or 3 or 4 had been added then the timer 
used would be Repeat t, Oneshot T, and Oneshot t where t = short time , and T = Long Time. Exit the KeyBrd and press the 
black [Cfg] then [McT] and then make sure to press the same button that have been set up - in this case [R-t]. Open 
notepad and wait for the repeating hello to appear. Note numbers 1-4 are for the countdown timers and numbers 5-8 are used
for the clock timers such as R-C or O-C as discussed below.

Change the timer values with *mt*x *mT*x *nt*x *nT*x where x = 0-9 - you can use the [*Cm] key and [ADD] one number 0-9
then press [EXE].

Currently only single macros from M, S and T 1-24 can be used for the timers - if a chained (linked) macro is used 
it will run the last macro used by the chain. The Timers are programmed as Time-Fire-Time-Fire. There will be an option
later to change this to Fire-Time-Fire-Time for the Repeat timers. The two real-time (using the Pico's HW RTC or Clock)
timers are configured by first setting the Clock Time by sending the string <tyymmddwhhmm> -> <t22110341439> is Thursday
3 Nov 2022 at 14h30. Then set the alarm time by sending the string <ayymmddwhhmm> -> <a22110601439> is Sunday 6 Nov 
2022 at 14h30. To send a repeat macro every 1 minute send <a-1-1-1--1-1> (the double -- is for the day of week not
significant), and associate with it 5 [R-C]. The clock time and alarm time are sent to a serial terminal and displayed
in the status bar by pressing [Cgf] twice. Can use a *code *tx*yymmddwhhmm to send all the clock values else send these
either manually using a serial terminal or use a Proccessing script, or a scheduled task powershell script. Note that 
the Pico has a HW RTC but does not have a dedicated battery backup for its HW RTC.

The Repeat-only mode (i.e send macro fixed number of times with a delay or no delay, is not implemented as yet.

Text Strings: 
Send new text strings up to 200 characters to keys S1/T1 - S12/T24 via USB serial
Start string with <1 to <6 followed by the string assigned to S1/T1-S24/T24 - end string with >
If current Layout is L3 then S1 to S6 changed, Layout L4 T1 to T6 changed, Layout L1 then M1 to M6 changed
If current Layer is A then M1/S1/T1-M6/S6/T6 changed, if Layer B M7/S7/T7-M12/S12/T12 changed etc. 
To store the string sent on SDCard rather than Flash make sure that the "A" to "D" colour is orange and not white
and that Layer 1, 3, or 4 is showing [L1][L3][L4]. The sent string will then be stored to the current SDCard file 
selected set 1 to 5 and to the filename selected by the first number after the starting < character.

Example 1.1: Indicator A-D is orange and Layer 3 [S]keys [S7] to [S12] is visible. SDCard set 2 is active (set with 
*sd*2[ADD][EXE]). Then use a serial terminal to send <1This is a string for key [S1].>. This string will then 
be stored in the SDCard file S0007.txt. When key [S7] is pressed with an orange A-D visible then this text will be 
printed. 
Example 1.2: A white "C" is showing and Layer 3 [S]keys [S13] to [S18] is visible. Then use a serial terminal to send 
<1This is a string for key [S1].>. This string will then be assigned to key [S13]. When key [S13] is pressed then
this text will be printed. 
Example 2: Send the macro 0x3C 0x34 0xE0 0xE1 0x29 0x3E (which is <4 Control Shift Escape >), 
with Layer 4 visible, then pressing [M4] will open the Task Manager.

PC Sensor Data: The sensor data read from HWInfo's Gadget Regisry data can be sent to the touchpad and displayed on the
LCD statusbar. The procedure is explained in detail in the MacropadPCSensorData section.

PC Music Playing Data: The Music Playing data read from Foobar2000's Now Playing Simple foobar2000 plugin, can be sent
to the touchpad and displayed on the LCD statusbar. The procedure is explained in detail in the MacropadFoobarPlaying

Date Time Display This is an alternative Date Time which is only displayed, and not used to set the Pico system 
time-date. The procedure is explained in detail in the SetDateTime section. This uses <T > and the system time date 
uses <t >.

Panic mode reset. If for any reason your keypad becomes unresponsive or behaves strangely reset it as follows:

(1) If the keys still send a *de* command using the second Pad. Then unplug or reset the keypad. This will delete all 
    files. macros and settings and you will need a re-calibration at start-up.
(2) Press either the white button on the Pico MCU baord and hold it in, then press the reset button once, and then only
    release the white button. Or unplug and re-plug the USB cable whilst holding and then release the Pico white button.
    The file manager should show a new storage device named RPI-RP2. Drag and drop any of the code.UF2 files to this 
    device. It will restart after a second or two. If this still does not reset the keypad then instead of the code.UF2 
    file drag and drop the file flash_nuke.uf2, wait a few seconds and then drag the code.UF2 file to the device.

On First Start: 
Do a four-arrow corner calibration - press at the TIP of each arrow just ONCE. If you make a mistake and press the same
corner twice it is likely that you will need a reset with the nuke.uf2 file (also provided here), because the LCD will 
not pick up the correct corner keys being touched.  

The default LCD settings are full brightness and when off full blank. Change these by pressing the second Pad on the 
right (k) or (gray), and then press then press [*Cm] until *bb* shows in status line at the LCD bottom. Then press the
[678] key twice (7 shows), press [ADD] and then press [EXE]. The normal use LCD Brightness is then set to 40 percent. 
Do the same for the LCD blank setting - press [*Cm] until *db* shows, then press the [345] key once (3 shows), then 
press [ADD] and [EXE] - this sets the blank LCD to 10 percent brightness when in sleep mode.

You can also increase the elapsed time period before the display dims - change it from the default 30 seconds to 300
seconds by selecting *tb* using the [*Cm] key, then press the [678] key once (6), and then press [ADD] and [EXE].

When the LCD has dimmed or blanked a first keypress is ignored - as it is used to restore the LCD to its selected 
brightness. Use [*Cm] *ks* [EXE] to enable or disable this key-skip behaviour.

The Volume Up and Down keys [V+] and [V-], are on by the default on a first start. To switch the Volume keys off 
press [Cfg] in Layout 2, then press [Vol]. Press the [Sav] key to save this Volume-off state - else it will be on 
again at the next switch-on. 

As a replacement for the Volume [V+] key choose from a set of 52 options (Del Bks Tab aTb Ins Esc PrS aPr Ret Snp 
Osk Num Cap Scr Cut Cpy Pst Tsk Run wX CPi Ts1 - Ts6 K1 -K24). With the Volume key off, press [Cfg] and then [Key]
once for [Del] key options, and twice for [Ret] key options. Press the bottom Pad [o] to select from the other 51
options. Press the [Sav] key to save the option chosen.
