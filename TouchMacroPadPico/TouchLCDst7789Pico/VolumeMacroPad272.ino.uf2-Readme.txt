Compiled with Pico SDK 1.51, TinyUSB 2.22, Arduino Pico 3.32, TFTeSPI 2.50, and Adafruit GFX 1.11.5

To install new version of Arduino Pico first delete it from boards manager, then delete the folder 
C:\Users\Name\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\rp2040 then close and reopen Arduino IDE and then add the new Arduino Pico Board.

NB: Use 2MB Flash option with 1MB Sketch 1 MB FS 
    Use Adafruit TinyUSB
    Use 125 MHz CPU

    An SDCard must be inserted for Macropad to start.


New changes:
Enabled a once-reset at start

Previous changes:
mathKeys.h and macroBanks.h as include files
Two admin powershell and command functions for M1 and M5
All other M keys default Powershell+command macrobank
Replaced button (reserved word) with Button
Use *am*n or *as*n or *at*n with n=1,2,3,4,5 for Keys M S T to choose between 3 different sets of 24 macro actions each, for each
set of 24 keys M,S,T Or choose between 2 sets of 24 differenr Run or CMD commands with n = 4,5.

Enabled the SDCard slot to be used for saving and reading files.
If a library SdFat_-_Adafruit_Fork exists move it out of the Arduino library path.
Every time that a new SDCard is inserted may require pressing the reset button of the Pico MCU once 
before the SDCard is recognised.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keys [S1] to [S24] Send SDCard file as keyboard characters to PC - the size of the files/strings are only 
limited by the SDCard size. Change between three SDCard file-sets of 24 files each with *sd*n where
n=1,2,3. For example use *sd*2[ADD][EXE] for second set of files. The folder SDCardFiles has a set of example
files. Change back to regular [S1]-[S24] key strings by pressing [s] Pad again so that X does not show but A-D.

Previous changes:
If the same Pad Key is pressed in its own Layout - for example press Option pad S when in the [S1] - [S24] keys layout,
it will then ignore any assigned strings and use the coded programmed action. Toggle it on/off by pressing the Pad once
or twice. This functions for all three keygroups M, S and T. The A,B,C,D indicator will change to "X" when this option is 
On, and back to A - D when it is Off.
Small correction to const static char StarCode for *e0* to *e4*
New include files coloursDef.h and keysDef.h for Key and Colour definitions, stringRSL.h and manual.h for Reboot, Shutdown, Logoff 
definitions and a User Guide.
Choose with *Code if first key pressed in LCD in dimmed state skipped i.e. used to wake LCD - toggle on/off with *ks*
NB corrected twice: for (n=0; n<6; n++) keycode[6] = 0x00; -> for (n=0; n<6; n++) keycode[n] = 0x00; 
Serial monitoring (via USB) on/off using *se*. A Red/Green "S" will indicate the state (Off/On). Switch the serial on if macros or other
text strings are sent to the Touchpad such as DateTime, Foobar Track Info, or HWInfo System Sensors. This setting is saved.
Operating System Option: Use *os*[EXE] to toggle between Windows, Linux, and Raspberry Pi OS. Currently only used for different Restart
or PowerOff or Logout options for the [ROf] key. These commands are working in Debian 11.7 but PiOS, Mint 21.1 and Ubuntu 22 sometimes
steal the focus from the Terminal to the Desktop search box. An alternative using Alt+F2 (Runbox) is presented at the end of the code 
section. Note that using these will show passwords as plaintext in the history. For Linux edit ShutDwn1 string and change PASSWORD and
USER.
There are now two string header files strings24.h for the S keys and stringt24.h for the T keys. Load these using *fs* *ft* and 
save them to flash using *ss* and *st*.
Date Time Display: This is alternative Date Time which is only displayed not used to set the Pico system time-date.
The procedure is explained in detail in the SetDateTime section.
Can now choose Layout 1,2,3 or 4 as the startup Layer - press [Cfg][1S4] repeatedly.
Fixed issue with A,B,C,D layer letter display
PC Music Playing Data: The Music Playing data read from Foobar2000's Now Playing Simple foobar2000 plugin, can be sent
to the touchpad and displayed on the LCD statusbar. The procedure is explained in detail in the MacropadFoobarPlaying section.
PC Sensor Data: The sensor data read from HWInfo's Gadget Regisry data can be sent to the touchpad and displayed on the
LCD statusbar. The procedure is explained in detail in the MacropadPCSensorData section.
Media Key Options: Previously pressing the media key [Cfg] then [Med], only displays the four Media controls Play-Pause, Next, 
Previous and Stop. To add the Volume Up and Down and the Mute keys press [Cfg][Vol] or [Cfg][1L4]. 
Using the four new *e1* to *e4* codes the action of this media key can be changed to display the (1) four Media Control Keys, 
(2) add the Volume Up/Down keys to the 4 control keys, (3) add the Mute key to (1) and (2), (4) add the Tone control keys. 
To disable this additional behaviour use the *e0* command. 
Change and save Mouse Cursor and Scroll movement: *m1*nn Scroll amount 1-10 (default 1) and *m2*nn Cursor move amount 1-99 (default 5). 
For example *m2*20 will change the cursor jump movement to 20 from the 5 default.
Mouse Keyboard:
When in Layer 2 - press middle pad [u] to toggle Mouse KeyBoard on/off - these are 12 mouse buttons,
scroll, and cursor movement keys:
[LBt]   [Up]  [RBt]   [Sc+]    [Left-Button]   [Cursor-Up]    [Right-Button]   [Scroll-Up]
[ < ]  [MBt]  [ > ]   [L2x]    [Cursor-Left] [Middle-Button]  [Cursor-Right] [Double-Left-Click]
[Bck]  [Dwn]  [Fwd]   [Sc-]    [Back-Button]  [Cursor-Down]  [Forward-Button]  [Scroll-Dwn]
Note that a Mouse Right-click can be also programmed as a Shift and F10.
Colour Scheme Changes
Added option for double ** to process strings starting with *
Added comment to end a shorter string that replaces a longer string with NULL char - press [GUI]3x and [ADD] at end of shorter string
