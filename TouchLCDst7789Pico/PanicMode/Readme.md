## Panic mode reset. 

*If for any reason your keypad becomes unresponsive or behaves strangely reset it as follows:*

(1) If the Config button [Cfg] still works press it once and then press the [Del]ete key at the left-hand bottom. Then unplug
    or reset the keypad. This will delete all files. macros and settings and you should have a re-calibration at start-up.
    
(2) Press either the white button at the bottom and hold it in, then press the black reset button at the back and release it 
    (or unplug and re-plug the USB cable instead of the rest button), then only release the white button at the bottom. The file
    manager should show a new storage device named RPI-RP2. Drag and drop any of the code.UF2 files to this device. It will 
    restart after a second or two. If this still does not reset the keypad then instead of the code.UF2 file drag and drop the
    file flash_nuke.uf2, wait a few seconds and then drag the code.UF2 file to the device.
