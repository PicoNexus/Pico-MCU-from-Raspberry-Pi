### Waveshare RP2040-Zero

This is a [**Pico-like MCU Board**](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-zero.htm) based on the Raspberry Pi MCU RP2040. [**Connections**](connections.jpg) are as shown below, and more details are [**here**](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RP2040-Zero). WaveRP2040ZeroNeopixel1.ino is a Neopixel demo for this board based on the Adafruit simple example.
